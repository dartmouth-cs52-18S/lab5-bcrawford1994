# starter express app template
I was able to successfully use all the curl commands to test the CRUD API of my blog through the back end, and I was also able to test the backend of Lab 5 by testing the frontend of my blog through Lab 4. I was also able to see data for posts in the browser before pointing my Lab 4 to my deployed Heroku App.


* node with babel
* expressjs
* airbnb eslint rules

Procfile set up to run on [heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app)
